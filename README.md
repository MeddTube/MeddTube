MeddTube Ruby on Rails Server - InnovateNYP Hackathon
========

Like FunnyOrDie + Google Helpouts, for healthcare. So you don't, uh, die.

This is the base code to work off of using Ruby on Rails server.  

I (David Tsay) will have my own deployed version on Heroku server at http://meddtube.heroku.com (Check it out!)

To run the server:

1. Install RoR (see guide at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
2. in your directory, run "rails server"
3. Direct your webbrowser (Chrome or Firefox) to http://localhost:3000

The server only loads the html, css, and javascript on demand, so you can edit these and just refresh your browser to see changes.

=============================

Overall Goal - Redesign myNYP.org for the 21st century

Assumptions 

1. Patients don't like to read - media is key! (Video / Data Visualization / Graphics)

- this includes:
-- Discharge Instructions
-- Medication Information
-- Disease Information
-- Lab information
-- Appointment Information
-- etc.

2. Patients like to talk to their providers, not to a computer
-- VIDEO VIDEO VIDEO - Video chat with your favorite pharmacist / Nurse / Doctor
-- Teleappointments
3. Patients don't like to figure anything out
-- Instructional videos should be sent to them via email/SMS etc
-- Everything on website should be stupidly simple and straightforward

Ok, now for the functional modular checklist in terms of most important to least (work on these in order)
