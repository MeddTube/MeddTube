MeddTube Ruby on Rails Server - InnovateNYP Hackathon
========

Like FunnyOrDie + Google Helpouts, for healthcare. So you don't, uh, die.

This is the base code to work off of using Ruby on Rails server.  

I (David Tsay) will have my own deployed version on Heroku server at http://telenyp.heroku.com

To run the server:

1. Install RoR (see guide at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
2. in your directory, run "rails server"
3. Direct your webbrowser (Chrome or Firefox) to http://localhost:3000

The server only loads the html, css, and javascript on demand, so you can edit these and just refresh your browser to see changes.
